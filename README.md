# Graph Data Structure Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a graph data structure using nodes and edges in C++. The main features include the creation of nodes, connections between nodes (edges), and the ability to traverse or manipulate the graph.

## Features
- **Node Management**: Create, delete, and manage nodes with unique IDs and associated data.
- **Edge Management**: Establish connections between nodes with weighted edges.
- **Traversal**: Basic graph traversal methods (e.g., BFS, DFS) can be implemented or extended.

## Code Structure
- **Node Class**: Represents a graph node with properties such as ID, data, position (x, y), and a linked list of edges.
- **Edge Struct**: Represents a connection between two nodes, including a weight for weighted graphs.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2. Compile the code:
    ```sh
    g++ main.cpp -o graph
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```sh
    ./graph
    ```

## Dependencies
- C++11 or later (Ensure that your compiler supports C++11 standards or higher).
